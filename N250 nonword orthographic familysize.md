# N250 nonword results Orthographic Family Size

The analysis of N250 amplitudes for nonwords revealed no main effects of Orthographic Sensitivity, Family Size, or Morphological Complexity, *all F*s < 2.5, *all p*s > .12. However, there was a **marginal interaction between Orthographic Sensitivity and Morphological Complexity**, *F*(1, 58) = 3.13, *p* = .082, η² = .05, and a **marginal three-way interaction among Orthographic Sensitivity, Family Size, and Complexity**, *F*(1, 1498) = 3.27, *p* = .071. No other interactions approached significance.

Follow-up estimated marginal means (averaged over Family Size) indicated that **participants low in orthographic sensitivity** exhibited a significantly larger (more negative) N250 for **simple** relative to **complex** nonwords, *t*(58) = 2.21, *p* = .031, *d* = 0.61, whereas **high-sensitivity participants** showed no difference between the two complexity levels, *t*(58) = 0.16, *p* = .88. Thus, the N250 complexity effect was present only among individuals with weaker orthographic knowledge.

Inspection of the three-way interaction showed that this complexity effect in the low-sensitivity group was most pronounced for **large-family nonwords** (Δ = −1.00 µV, *d* ≈ 0.7) and somewhat smaller for **small-family nonwords** (Δ = −0.74 µV, *d* ≈ 0.5), whereas high-sensitivity participants displayed uniformly moderate N250 amplitudes (≈ −0.5 µV) across all conditions. This pattern indicates that the complexity-related modulation of the N250 depends jointly on morphological structure and individual differences in orthographic expertise.

Taken together, these results suggest that **participants with lower orthographic sensitivity engage more effortful, surface-based processing** when nonwords lack morphological structure, producing a more negative N250. In contrast, **participants with higher orthographic sensitivity process both simple and complex nonwords with comparable efficiency**, reflecting more automatic and uniform sublexical segmentation.
