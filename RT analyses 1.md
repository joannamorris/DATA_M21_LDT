## **Word Analyses**

Response times to real words showed clear effects of both base frequency and morphological family size but no reliable interactions with individual differences in orthographic or semantic sensitivity. Across models, words derived from low-frequency bases and smaller morphological families elicited slower responses, consistent with slower lexical access for less familiar and less morphologically connected words.

### **Effects of Orthographic Sensitivity**

The model including Orthographic Sensitivity revealed significant main effects of both Base Frequency, *F*(1, 92.45) = 10.29, *p* = .002, η²ₚ = .10, and Family Size, *F*(1, 92.44) = 9.41, *p* = .003, η²ₚ = .09. High-frequency words were recognized faster (*M* = 602 ms, 95% CI [583, 622]) than low-frequency words (*M* = 622 ms, 95% CI [603, 641]), and words from large morphological families were recognized faster (*M* = 603 ms, 95% CI [584, 622]) than those from small families (*M* = 622 ms, 95% CI [602, 641]). The main effect of Orthographic Sensitivity was marginal, *F*(1, 64.87) = 3.83, *p* = .055, η²ₚ = .06, with a numerical trend toward faster responses among participants with higher orthographic sensitivity. No interactions among Base Frequency, Family Size, or Orthographic Sensitivity were significant (*F*s < 1.1). The model accounted for 36% of total variance (*R*²₍conditional₎ = .36), with fixed effects explaining about 3% (*R*²₍marginal₎ = .03).

### **Effects of Semantic Sensitivity**

When Orthographic Sensitivity was replaced with Semantic Sensitivity, the same pattern of lexical effects emerged. Significant main effects of Base Frequency, *F*(1, 92.29) = 10.15, *p* = .002, η²ₚ = .10, and Family Size, *F*(1, 92.30) = 9.28, *p* = .003, η²ₚ = .09, again indicated faster responses for high-frequency (*M* = 601 ms, 95% CI [581, 621]) than low-frequency words (*M* = 621 ms, 95% CI [601, 640]) and for large-family (*M* = 603 ms, 95% CI [584, 622]) than small-family words (*M* = 621 ms, 95% CI [602, 641]). No main or interaction effects involving Semantic Sensitivity approached significance (*F*s < 1.1). The model explained a comparable proportion of total variance (*R*²₍conditional₎ = .36), with a smaller contribution from fixed effects (*R*²₍marginal₎ = .01).

## **Nonword Analyses – Semantic Sensitivity**

Response times to morphologically complex nonwords were consistently slower than to simple nonwords across all analyses, indicating robust processing costs associated with morphological complexity. Two complementary models examined whether these complexity effects were modulated by lexical-level properties of the base forms—morphological family size and base frequency—and by participants’ semantic sensitivity.

### **Effects of Morphological Family Size**

The model including Family Size and Semantic Sensitivity revealed a strong main effect of Complexity, *F*(1, 4528) = 122.09, *p* < .001, η²ₚ = .12, but no main effects of Family Size or Semantic Sensitivity (*F*s < 1). Importantly, a significant three-way *Complexity × Family Size × Semantic Sensitivity* interaction emerged, *F*(1, 4443) = 4.84, *p* = .028, η²ₚ = .01. Follow-up contrasts showed that participants with high semantic sensitivity exhibited a larger complexity effect for nonwords derived from large morphological families (mean difference = 45 ms, *d* = 0.44, 95% CI [33, 56]) than for those from small families (27 ms, *d* = 0.26, 95% CI [16, 38]). In contrast, participants with low semantic sensitivity showed little or no difference across family sizes. The resulting interaction contrast confirmed that the difference in complexity costs between high- and low-sensitivity groups was approximately 27 ms (95% CI [3, 51]), *p* = .028. These results suggest that individuals with greater semantic knowledge were more sensitive to morphological family structure, showing amplified complexity effects when novel forms resembled morphologically rich lexical neighborhoods.
The model accounted for 40% of total variance (*R*²₍conditional₎ = .40) and 5% for fixed effects (*R*²₍marginal₎ = .05).

### **Effects of Base Frequency**

When morphological Family Size was replaced with Base Frequency, both factors again influenced response times. Complex nonwords were slower than simple ones, *F*(1, 4533) = 125.15, *p* < .001, η²ₚ = .12, and nonwords derived from low-frequency bases elicited slower responses than those derived from high-frequency bases, *F*(1, 95) = 12.70, *p* < .001, η²ₚ = .11. The *Complexity × Base Frequency* interaction was significant, *F*(1, 4535) = 3.92, *p* = .048, η²ₚ = .01, indicating that the complexity effect was larger for nonwords derived from high-frequency bases (mean difference = 41 ms, *d* = 0.41, 95% CI [32, 50]) than for those from low-frequency bases (29 ms, *d* = 0.28, 95% CI [21, 37]). The interaction contrast confirmed that the complexity cost increased by approximately 12 ms (95% CI [0.1, 24.8]), *p* = .048. No effects involving Semantic Sensitivity were observed (*F*s < 1.2), suggesting that this frequency-based modulation of complexity costs was consistent across participants.
The model explained 41% of total variance (*R*²₍conditional₎ = .41) and 4% for fixed effects (*R*²₍marginal₎ = .04).

Together, these models indicate that nonword processing is influenced by both the structural richness and the lexical familiarity of the base forms on which novel items are modeled. The complexity cost was generally larger when nonwords were derived from high-frequency or large-family bases, particularly among participants with greater semantic sensitivity, suggesting that lexical-semantic experience enhances morphological expectations during the processing of unfamiliar word forms.

## **Nonword Analyses – Orthographic Sensitivity**

### **Grouping by Family Size**

The analysis of response times for nonwords grouped by Family Size revealed a robust main effect of Complexity, *F*(1, 4529) = 124.76, *p* < .001, η²ₚ = .12, such that participants responded more slowly to complex nonwords (*M* = 737 ms, *SE* = 11 ms) than to simple nonwords (*M* = 701 ms, *SE* = 11 ms). There was also a significant main effect of Orthographic Sensitivity, *F*(1, 64) = 5.37, *p* = .024, η²ₚ = .08, indicating generally slower responses among participants low in orthographic sensitivity relative to high-sensitivity participants. No other main effects or interactions reached significance (*F*s < 1.1, *p*s > .29). The model accounted for 39% of total variance (*R*²₍conditional₎ = .39) and 5% for fixed effects (*R*²₍marginal₎ = .05).

### **Grouping by Base Frequency**

When nonwords were grouped by Base Frequency, the model again revealed a strong main effect of Complexity, *F*(1, 4534) = 127.54, *p* < .001, η²ₚ = .12: responses were slower for complex than for simple nonwords. There was also a significant main effect of Base Frequency, *F*(1, 96) = 12.99, *p* < .001, η²ₚ = .11, with nonwords derived from high-frequency base forms (hereafter “high-frequency nonwords”) eliciting longer response times than those derived from low-frequency bases. A main effect of Orthographic Sensitivity was again observed, *F*(1, 64) = 5.32, *p* = .024, η²ₚ = .08, reflecting slower overall responses among participants low in orthographic sensitivity.

Importantly, the analysis also identified a *Complexity × Base Frequency* interaction, *F*(1, 4536) = 4.26, *p* = .039, η²ₚ = .01. Follow-up contrasts confirmed that the complexity effect (Complex – Simple) was larger for high-frequency nonwords (Δ = 42 ms, *z* = 9.03, *p* < .001, *d* = 0.41) than for low-frequency nonwords (Δ = 29 ms, *z* = 6.83, *p* < .001, *d* = 0.29), a difference of 13 ms (95% CI [0.7, 25.5]). Thus, participants were particularly slowed by morphological complexity when nonwords were derived from high-frequency base forms, suggesting that lexical familiarity magnified the cost of parsing morphologically complex pseudowords. No interactions involving Orthographic Sensitivity were significant (*F*s < 1, *p*s > .35).
The model accounted for 41% of total variance (*R*²₍conditional₎ = .41) and 4% for fixed effects (*R*²₍marginal₎ = .04).

Together, these findings indicate that morphological complexity reliably increases response times for nonwords, regardless of grouping by Family Size or Base Frequency. However, the size of this complexity effect was modulated by base frequency, being most pronounced for high-frequency items, while participants low in orthographic sensitivity responded more slowly overall across conditions.

## **Summary and Transition**

Response times reflected opposing effects of lexical and morphological structure for words and nonwords. For real words, responses were faster for items derived from high-frequency bases and large morphological families, consistent with facilitated access to well-established lexical representations. For nonwords, however, those same lexical properties generally slowed responses, particularly when the items were morphologically complex or derived from high-frequency bases, indicating that more wordlike pseudowords were harder to reject.

Individual differences further modulated these effects. Word recognition was largely unaffected by orthographic or semantic sensitivity, but nonword responses showed reliable interactions between morphological structure and sensitivity: participants with higher linguistic sensitivity exhibited larger complexity effects and greater slowing for morphologically rich pseudowords. These findings suggest that linguistic experience amplifies lexical activation and morphological decomposition during the evaluation of unfamiliar forms.

Together, the behavioral results reveal complementary influences of lexical familiarity and individual differences on visual word recognition and morphological generalization—providing a foundation for the ERP analyses that follow, which test whether similar lexicality-dependent patterns emerge in the N250 and N400 time windows.
