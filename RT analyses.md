Yes ‚Äî let‚Äôs walk carefully through your **reported results** and check that the interpretation above truly matches the empirical direction of effects in both the **word** and **nonword** data. I‚Äôll go step by step by variable and lexicality.

## üß† 1. **Words**

### Model summary (Orthographic and Semantic Sensitivity models)

* **Base Frequency:** significant main effect, *F*(1, 92.45) = 10.29, *p* = .002 ‚Äî
  *High-frequency words ‚Üí faster RTs* (M = 602 ms) than *low-frequency words* (M = 622 ms).
  ‚úÖ **Facilitatory effect** of frequency on *word recognition.*

* **Family Size:** significant main effect, *F*(1, 92.44) = 9.41, *p* = .003 ‚Äî
  *Large-family words ‚Üí faster RTs* (M = 603 ms) than *small-family words* (M = 622 ms).
  ‚úÖ **Facilitatory effect** of morphological connectivity.

* **No interactions** with Orthographic or Semantic Sensitivity.
  ‚úÖ **Individual differences did not modulate word RTs.**

So for **words**, effects were purely facilitative: larger family and higher frequency ‚Üí faster ‚Äúword‚Äù responses.

## üß© 2. **Nonwords**

### (a) **Semantic Sensitivity √ó Family Size**

* **Complexity:** robust main effect ‚Äî *Complex* slower than *Simple* nonwords.
  ‚úÖ Morphological decomposition cost.

* **Family Size:** no main effect.

* **Complexity √ó Family Size √ó Semantic Sensitivity:** significant.

  * High Semantic Sensitivity ‚Üí larger *Complexity* effect for *large-family* nonwords (45 ms) than *small-family* nonwords (27 ms).
  * Low Sensitivity ‚Üí little or no difference.
    ‚úÖ For sensitive participants, greater morphological *neighborhood richness* increased the complexity cost ‚Äî i.e., they were *slower* for large-family derived nonwords.

Interpretation: **large-family structure increased difficulty for nonword rejection**, particularly in high-sensitivity readers.
That aligns with the idea that *more wordlike* nonwords (derived from many real relatives) are **harder to reject**.

---

### (b) **Semantic Sensitivity √ó Base Frequency**

* **Complexity:** robust main effect ‚Äî *Complex* slower than *Simple*.

* **Base Frequency:** significant ‚Äî *Low-frequency base ‚Üí slower nonword RTs* than *High-frequency base*.
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Wait ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite of the ‚Äúmore wordlike ‚Üí harder to reject‚Äù prediction.
  It suggests that nonwords from *low-frequency bases* are actually *harder* (slower) to reject.

* **Complexity √ó Base Frequency:** significant ‚Äî larger complexity cost for *high-frequency* bases (Œî = 41 ms) than *low-frequency* (Œî = 29 ms).
  So the *interaction* actually reintroduces the expected direction: **for complex nonwords, high-frequency bases magnified slowing**.

Hence:

* Simple low-frequency nonwords = easiest (fastest).
* Complex high-frequency nonwords = hardest (slowest).
  ‚úÖ Overall pattern: *morphological complexity* and *wordlikeness* (via base frequency) both increased RTs ‚Äî consistent with the ‚Äúharder-to-reject‚Äù interpretation.

---

### (c) **Orthographic Sensitivity models**

* Similar story: **main effect of Complexity**, **main effect of Orthographic Sensitivity** (low sensitivity ‚Üí slower overall).
* **Complexity √ó Base Frequency** again significant: complexity cost larger for *high-frequency* bases.
  ‚úÖ Again, more wordlike = slower to reject.

## ‚úÖ 3. **Summary of the Data Patterns**

| Lexicality      | Variable                 | Direction                                                | Interpretation                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Words**       | High Base Frequency      | Faster                                                   | Facilitated access                            |
|                 | Large Family             | Faster                                                   | Facilitated access                            |
| **Nonwords**    | High Base Frequency      | *Sometimes slower* (esp. complex forms)                  | Harder to reject / greater lexical activation |
|                 | Large Family             | Slower (esp. for high semantic sensitivity)              | More lexical competition                      |
|                 | Morphological Complexity | Slower                                                   | Parsing cost for derived structure            |
| **Sensitivity** | Orthographic/Semantic    | Amplifies nonword complexity effects; no effect on words | Experience-based decomposition differences    |

So:

* For words ‚Üí facilitatory effects (more wordlike = faster).
* For nonwords ‚Üí inhibitory effects (more wordlike = slower), especially for morphologically complex forms and for sensitive participants.
